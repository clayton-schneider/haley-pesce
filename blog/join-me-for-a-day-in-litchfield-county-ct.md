Ciao Ciao! It's a Sunday morning and I woke up to a light dusting on the ground. My mother and I went on an early morning walk to embrace the white coat that mother nature draped over the trees that night. We did our favorite hiking trail throughout the woods. In Roxbury, a rural farm town of 2,000 people, you can never get sick of the amazing nature preserves and beauty the town has to offer. Anyways, after that, my parents and I had our morning tea in the "blue room" (not sure why we started calling it the blue room, but I'm pretty sure it's just because we have a blue couch in the room). Every morning we wake up and have our organic black tea with oat milk while we discuss the day's activities and just take time without distraction to enjoy each other's company. I will say this is the thing I miss most since being back at school. Taking that small amount of time in the morning, without phones or media is so important in a time where we are constantly consumed by work and the outside world. It really set me up each morning for a relaxing and productive day.

My parents had off from work so logically, we were going to have an amazing day. My brother had already gone back to school so it was just the three of us. It was one of my last days home from break so we wanted to soak it all in and have a festive day around the county. We had an especially long blue room talk that morning so we didn't leave the house until 11:30. At this point we were ravenous. We decided to head up to the Bantam Bread Company in Litchfield, CT. Now I am not one to sit down and eat plain rolls, but you best bet that their rolls are worth every. single. calorie. We entered the shop and the New York residents and locals were coming in droves. We are lucky they weren't out of bread by the time we arrived. As we walked into the shop we were immediately acquainted with the comforting scent of fresh-baked bread. On the bottom shelf of the cooling rack were these decadent sesame seed dinner rolls, with steam still coming off of them. Without question, we bought a couple to taste as we waited for our other goodies. As you pulled the roll apart, steam flowed out as you watched the yeasty-pull of the bread. CAN SOMEONE SAY HEAVENNNN?! We also ordered a fresh sesame seed Semolina loaf and a kalamata olive sourdough loaf to enjoy later on.

Then, we decided to try a new restaurant we'd been dying to try- The Marketplace Tavern in Litchfield, CT. This restaurant was built in the old jail and we enjoyed an amazing lunch next to a former jail cell. My father had the steak sandwich (not pictured), my mother had the beet & burrata salad atop a bead of arugula and I had their black bean veggie burger without the bun, on top of avocado and bibb lettuce. Of course, an obligatory side of sweet potato fries was a MUST! All of the dishes were amazing and we really enjoyed our meal.

Following lunch, we ventured to the local antique shop, the Housatonic Trading Company and simply browsed the lovely decor they had to offer.

When we arrived home later that evening, we enjoyed a glass of wine and a peace of the kalamata olive sourdough bread which was AMAZING!! I decided to make a light dinner since we indulged a little too much in that loaf of bread. I made a cannellini bean & escarole dish courtesy of Giada DiLaurentis and a side salad of baby kale, raw fennel, and oranges. We ended the night while watching our new favorite show, The Crown (a stellar show on Netflix about the early life of Queen Elizabeth).

Especially in Litchfield County, we have so much history and traditions to explore. So stoked you guys are gonna be able to experience life with me and this blog!! Thank you so much for your endless support through this long process. Embrace the ride :) xoxo, HCP EATS
