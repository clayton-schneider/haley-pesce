  In all of the craziness surrounding the Coronavirus, it can be overwhelming to
  know where to start when investing in your health. Read below for the 5 things
  I do and encourage others to do to keep their immune systems in tip-top shape.
  All of these tips are Homeopathic and can be done with things lying around
  your house or in your nearest health food store. Enjoy, and stay healthy :)

• Drink a hot lemon/ginger water each morning on an empty stomach. This might sound silly but it is key, and something I do everyday, regardless of the illness threats looming. Take a teapot and pour in boiling water. Slice up half a lemon and add that into the water after squeezing each piece a bit. Grate up a knob of fresh ginger (or ground ginger is fine) and add that in as well. Let that steep for about 10 minutes before drinking, to ensure all the goodness is infused. Drink one cup each morning on an empty stomach. If the taste is too bitter for you then adding a teaspoon of honey is a great option! This is so powerful for your immune system because it allows your body to cleanse itself and promotes a healthy gut and proper digestion. This ensures that your body is functioning properly, giving your body the energy to ward off illness. If you want some extra cold-fighting ideas try added cayenne or apple cider vinegar!

• Get plenty of rest!! This may seem like a no-brainer but especially for people with busy schedules, sleep as a priority can get thrown to the wayside. I aim for about 8-9 hours of sleep each night in order to give my body the rest it needs to remain healthy. This idea of self-care and relaxation is crucial to supporting your immune system, giving your body sufficient energy, even if it means not sitting on your phone for hours before bed.

• Take some immune-boosting natural supplements: Elderberry, Echinacea, Turmeric, Wellness Formula, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Iron, Herbs, and Fish Oils. I take at least a few of these on a daily basis and all of these when I am trying to prevent illness. These can be found at your local health food store, pharmacy, or even online from Amazon.  If you have a hard time taking pills, most of these can be found in liquid, powder, or even tea form (all of which are great). [Source Naturals](https://www.sourcenaturals.com/), [Nature's Bounty](https://www.naturesbounty.com/) and [Pure Herbs](https://www.pureherbs.com/) are the brands that I use most frequently but all of the brands shown below are ones that I use and trust for my supplements. These keep me healthy all year-round since I practice a homeopathic lifestyle. For the teas, [Traditional Medicinals](https://www.traditionalmedicinals.com/) is the brand I use and 100% recommend. These can be found in all grocery stores.

* Get outside to breathe in some fresh air and exercise! This might seen hard to do when its dead of winter but with the temps being so tame, it's the perfect time to get that fresh air!! Especially with the recent quarantines, stepping outside for a bit will make you feel ALIVE! Getting the necessary amounts of vitamin D are essential to proper bodily function so be sure to put your face up to the sun and soak up those rays. If you are not feeling 100%, I'd recommend a rejuvenating walk or hike, nothing too strenuous on the body. This winter I did a ton of skiing with my family, which is a great form of physical activity while enjoying quality time with loved ones (something we all need in times of chaos).

* Have a healthy diet focused on whole foods! I am mainly plant-based so I eat tons of raw fruits and veggies each day in order to keep my body strong. Whole foods give us the necessary nutrients we need to fuel our body. Make sure you are getting adequate amounts of healthy fats and proteins as well. Luckily there are a lot of natural carbs and sugars in fruits and veggies. Some of my favorite healthy fats include: avocados, extra virgin olive oil/coconut oil/ghee, nuts & seeds, OMEGA-3s (fish), dark chocolate. As for proteins, I eat vegan/vegatarian proteins which is tougher to get the necessary amounts you need. I look to: Orgain protein powder, beans, quinoa, farro, tempeh/tofu (in small amounts because they're processed protein types), edamame, leafy greens, seeds (chia/hemp/sunflower), non-dairy milk, cocoa powder. and chickpeas. For those who are not plant-based, I'd recommend organic and free-range eggs/chicken/beef, organic milk, organic yogurt, organic cheese, and fresh seafood. People say you are what you eat, so if you expect your body to be healthy and function properly, you must give it the goodness it demands!
