Hello Everyone! My name is Haley Christine Pesce and I am a rising Senior at Babson College. Throughout my life, I have placed huge importance on fitness and maintaining proper nutrition. Being outdoors and appreciating all that the world has to offer is at the center of my life, realizing my passion for traveling. I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to live a wholesome and beautiful life, through proper understanding in the world around them.



Just a little bit about me- being a three-sport athlete my entire life, I decided to become a member of the Babson Field Hockey team in 2016. I am a Marketing and Global Business Management Major with my hope to start my own business in the Nutrition/Fitness Industry. I have just wrapped up an extremely eye-opening semester abroad in Florence, Italy with Syracuse University, which I intend to share with you over the upcoming months. I am so glad that you have decided to begin this journey with me! I chose to launch this website in hopes to share my fitness and nutrition tips with the world. I will use this platform to share my favorite recipes, workouts, and travel tips around the world. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you might have. Enjoy!
