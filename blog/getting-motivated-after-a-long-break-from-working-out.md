I don't know about you all but Seasonal Affective Disorder is in FULLLLLL swing this winter, with all of the rain and lack of sunshine. It makes you just want to cuddle up with a good movie and a tub of cookie dough. The last thing you wanna do is venture out into the cold and drag yourself to the gym. This is something I've seriously been struggling with recently after getting sick. I had that typical college flu which left me basically immobile for 2 weeks. Now, I'm journeying back to health and working out sounds seriously unappealing haha. 

Realistically, a 2-week hiatus can be extremely beneficial for your body to recovery and it is essential to rest while you're sick to allow your body to heal properly. Your body can actually thrive greatly from a longer period of time off but at some point we all gotta get back on track. At this moment I just finished my first official workout since being sick and oh baby does it feel good to be back! However, it took a serious motivational speech to get my butt there. Here are some tips that I used to regain that motivation that I wanted to share with y'all! Enjoy my loves!

* Start Slow- this weekend I did physical activity that was FUNNN and less structured, as I went skiing and hiking with my parents up in Vermont. This reminded me how amazing it felt to breathe in some fresh air and move my body!

* Think about that post-workout high you'll feel. I know for me personally, I sleep 10x better when I include some physical exercise into my daily routine, so this was a HUGE motivator for me! 
* Overall Health- Remember that a large part of being healthy includes movement of your body on a daily basis. Especially with our busy schedules, placing some time aside for self-care and wellness is essential. Working out ensures your metabolism, digestion, and other bodily functions are working as they should! 
* Use this hiatus to change up your working routine to make it something you enjoy more. When working out, it easy to get into a slump of doing the same thing each day. Working out can become so habitual that its no longer enjoyable. Studies have even shown that mixing up your workout forms allows your body to obtain all of the benefits from each movement type. I have recently implemented more yoga into my workout schedule, as I want to improve my flexibility and give my body time to de-stress and refuel. I have personally noticed such a difference in my mental state and overall recognition of my bodily state. I seriously recommend this for all, especially if you're looking to incorporate more low-impact movement!
