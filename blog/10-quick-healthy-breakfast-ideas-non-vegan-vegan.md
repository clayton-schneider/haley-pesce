---
Hello my beautiful people! In my inquiry for new blog topics you guys were looking for, I got a lovely request from Allie Steers for quick & healthy breakfast options. These days, especially if you’re a student or rushing off to work, you may not have the time to make an extravagant breakfast. However, that doesn’t mean that you can slump out on getting the proper nutrients your body needs to power through your busy schedule! Here are some amazing options for your weekday breakfasts. These are all meals I have made in the morning before class or work in less than 30 minutes (some requiring little time in the morning if it’s prepped the night before). I hope you enjoy this mixup with 10 meals for every sweet/savory craving you may have! Enjoyyyyyy and send me pics of your creations! ⭐️



## 1. Overnight Oats -- 

This is probably my go-to breakfast these days, especially since going plant-based. It is soooo easy and you can prep it all the night before in 5 minutes. In the morning, just pull it out of the fridge and add any toppings you desire and VOILA!

![overnight oats](/uploads/img_0409.jpg)


**My Go-To Recipe** (there are many variations online, and others I have if you want!):

* 1 cup oats
* 1 cup plant-based milk (you can use regular milk or water works perfect as well)
* 1 TBS chia seeds
* 1 TBS honey 
* 1/2 cup frozen berries or 1/2 banana
* Pinch of sea salt
* Dash of cinnamon

\*\*Combine all ingredients in a bowl the night before and place in the fridge. These can last for up to 5 days so feel free to make on Monday for the whole week! 
Possible toppings: nut butter, fresh berries/banana, goji berries, cocoa nibs, or granola. 



## 2. Avocado Toast
 

This has been a staple in my diet ever since I began working at my health food store, A New Leaf in Needham, MA. The avocado gives you all the healthy fats you need, and you can make so many variations with toppings so it's never boring!

**My Recipe w/ two variations:**

* 2 slices gluten free bread (you can sub any bread your heart desires) -- MUST BE TOASTED
* 1/2 ripe avocado
* 1 TBS of hummus on each slice for more #proteinpower 
* Sliced cucumber
* Roasted red pepper (1st picture)
* Spinach (2nd picture)
* Himalayan salt
* Pepper
* Red chili flakes (my must-have topping for a little KICK)
* EBTB seasoning is fabulous as well

\*\*Assemble as you please, and get creative!! 



## 3. Egg-white Omelette and Kodiak Cakes

Alright alright, Kodiak Cakes are legit my faveeeeee. If you haven't heard of these, check them out [HERE](https://kodiakcakes.com/). These pancakes are PACKED with protein, and are a great post workout snack. All you have to do is purchase the pancake mix and mix equal parts water/almond milk/regular milk with the mix and you're DONE! The batter can be made ahead of time for ease in the morning. The Kodiak Cakes can be eaten on their own honestly because they're so filling. I eat three 4 inch cakes and I'm stuffedddd. However, I'm throwing in an egg-white omelette here for ya!

![egg white omelette and kodiak cakes](/uploads/img_0482.jpg)

**My Recipe:**

**PANCAKES-** 1/2 cup mix with 1/2 cup water/milk of choice -- this can sit in the fridge overnight so all you have to do is put some spray/butter in the pan and then cook the cakes! Feel free to add some blueberries or chocolate chips on top for a little more sweetness! This is a quick 10 minute meal and these cakes can be taken to go cause they're so yummy especially if you get the flavored mixes. 

**Egg-white Omelette-** Before I went vegan, I took the chance of buying some packaged egg-white cartons and they were soooo easy -- these can be found at most food stores now! It sounds gross I know but with some seasoning it was delish! Just pour 1/2 cup of egg-whites in a nonstick pan and add any veggies you want. I personally love adding some Green Pepper Cholula, salt and pepper. 

Both of these options are low in calorie and packed with protein for those focusing on macros. 



## 4. Medical Medium Heavy Metal Detox Smoothie


Medical Medium (Anthony William) has devoted his life to helping people overcome chronic illnesses. Since age four, Anthony has been using his gift to “read” people's conditions and tell them how to recover their health. His unprecedented accuracy and success rate as the Medical Medium have earned him the trust and love of millions worldwide, among them movie stars, rock stars, billionaires, professional athletes who couldn't find a way to heal until he provided them with insights. Some of his followers include: Pharrell Williams, Novak Djokovic, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jenna Dewan, and Miranda Kerr. He has a series of books that I have read and I now follow several of his practices, which have made me feel better than ever. Check out his website [HERE](https://www.medicalmedium.com/). 

![heavy metal detox smoothie](/uploads/aa9266a909d89f35c03637a1b8dd981a.jpg)

**His Recipe:** 

* 2 bananas
* 2 cups wild blueberries
* 1 cup cilantro
* 1 cup orange juice
* 1 tsp barley grass juice powder
* 1 tsp spirulina
* 1 small handful of Atlantic dulse
* Optional: water to blend

\*\*Toxic heavy metals are virtually everywhere, and are present in things we come in contact with every day. As a result, most of us are carrying around heavy metals that have been with us for almost our whole lives and which have burrowed deep inside our tissues.
 These completely compromise our immune system, leaving us vulnerable to many diseases. Blend these ingredients and enjoy! This and other smoothies are great options for quick on-the-go meals. 



## 5. Egg-whites on Rye Toast with Veggies



![egg whites on toast](/uploads/470e64b9-11ad-48c5-b56c-44e5d44d90d4.jpg)

**My Recipe:**

* Two slices rye bread -- TOASTED
* 1/2 cup egg-whites scrambled with fresh kale (use any veggies you'd like)
* Sriracha to top
* While the eggs scrambled, I microwaved a sweet potato for about 6-minutes on HIGH. 



## 6. Juice

![juice](/uploads/807750ad-3d93-4dd2-95de-eb926424e8c7.jpg)


Juices are tough unless you have a juicer at home, or a juice place on the way to work/school. However, juices are a great way to pack a ton of your daily servings for fruits and veggies into one cup! Just drinking the juice without all of the pulp gives your body an easy way to digest the nutrients properly. Plus, it takes a lot less time than eating like a million fruits/veggies.

**My Go-To Recipe:**

* 1 green apple
* 1/2 lemon
* 1 knob of fresh ginger
* 1/2 heart of celery
* 1 handful of kale



## 7.  Veggie-Egg Frittata

This is so simple to make and this can be made on Sunday and divided into to-go slices for Monday-Friday. Simply take a slice and microwave it in the morning before you eat it. This frittata is so hearty, packed with all the essentials, and keeps very well. 

![veggie frittata](/uploads/img_1709.jpg)


**My Recipe:**

1. Mandolin or slice thinly 2 medium-sized sweet potatoes -- place slices along the bottom of the pie dish and then up around the edges
2. Whisk together 12 eggs and 1/2 cup milk 
3. Pour some of the egg mixture on top until it covers the sweet potatoes
4. Saute 2 large onions and 5 cups of spinach (don't worry this all reduces down sooo much) -- place on top of the egg mixture
5. Dice 3 medium-sized tomatoes and 1/3 head of broccoli -- add this on top. 
6. Cover with the remaining egg mixture
7. Cook in the oven at 400 degrees F for about an 1.5 hours (this can vary based on your oven)

\*\*This makes about 10 servings. Microwave for 3 minutes once removed from the fridge.



## 8. Grain-Free Banana Walnut Muffins


This is a new recipe I found from @kalejunkie on Instagram. I love baking these on Sunday and storing them in an airtight container for a quick grab&go in the morning. These can last the whole week! These are packed with protein, super healthy, and really filling with a piece of fruit! Check out her website for more inspo [HERE](https://www.kalejunkie.com/).

![grain-free banana walnut muffins](/uploads/d133b43e-0a36-4290-8865-46bedfe39dc6.jpg)

**INGREDIENTS
:**

* 3 organic pasture raised eggs
* 4 spotty bananas
* 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup nut butter of choice (I used Georgia Grinders Almond Butter)
* 1/2 cup coconut flour
* 1 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg
* pinch sea salt
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
* 1 tsp baking soda

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

* Preheat oven to 350. 
* Line a muffin tin with liners. I always get 9-10 muffins from this recipe depending on how large your bananas are! 
* In a blender, add the bananas, eggs, coconut oil, vanilla extract, and nut butter. Blend until smooth. 
* Next add the coconut flour, sea salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and baking soda. 
* Blend for about 20 seconds until incorporated. 
* Transfer batter to a bowl and fold in most of the walnuts, saving a few to sprinkle on top. 
* Use a spoon to scoop batter into the muffin cavities, filling 3/4 way to the top. 
* Add remaining walnuts. 
* Bake for 16-18 minutes, until they look set on top and a toothpick comes out clean. 



## 9. Yogurt w/ Homemade Granola 


I love this next one, courtesy of my good friend Carla and her mother. There is nothing quite like homemade granola. I personally love this breakfast because it's quick and yogurt gives you the necessary probiotics to promote gut health. I have been loving Kite Hill yogurts because they're made from almond milk (but you can use any type of yogurt - just avoid the yogurts with a TON of added sugars). Mix one container of yogurt (about 1/2 cup) with 1/4 cup of granola.

**Recipe** (again, this can be made ahead of time):

## 10. Banana & PB on Rice Cakes


This is a great idea for a quick grab and go breakfast, and this can be placed in a Tupperware and brought with you. 

![rice cakes](/uploads/f468b9ea-21a9-4504-ab5f-9e67b0a1908b.jpg)


**My Recipe:**

* 2 apple cinnamon rice cakes
* 2 TBS PB Fit (mix w/ 2 TBS of water) and spread on rice cakes -- you can also use regular nut butter!
* 1 large banana - 1/2 on each rice cake
* Sprinkle cinnamon on top
