  Looking for quick dinners to make for the entire family? These vegan veggie
  burgers can be the cure to all your problems!

Don't let the name fool you! These vegan veggie burgers are super filling and crazy delicious. Even my dad who's a huge meat-lover couldn't rave enough about them! They're also a great meat substitute, especially when the ground beef is disappearing rapidly from local food stores. Scientists are saying that if each person tries to reduce meat consumption by 50%, it could greatly decrease the negative climate change impacts we are seeing. So if not for the increased veggies in your diet, then do it for the planet!! 

I recommend making these burgers in big batches to get the largest bang for your buck but try them once and make sure you like them first!! (which you totally will) :) I would double or even triple the recipe, and freeze the rest of the patties you don't eat right away. This makes for a quick and easy prepared dinner (as shown below with my portobello mushroom bun, and roasted potatoes). I also had it a second night in a row with chickpea/lentil rice & ginger/turmeric carrots. ENJOY!

## RECIPE:

1. Preheat oven to 400F degrees. Take about 3 medium sized sweet potatoes, slice them length-wise down the middle, and place them face down on a baking sheet. Bake them for around 40 minutes or until tender with a fork. Remove those from the oven and let them cool. 
2. Take 1/3 cup of uncooked quinoa and combine it with 2/3 cup of water in a saucepan. Bring this mixture to a boil, then cover and bring to a simmer for 15 minutes. Then, remove it from heat and let it sit for 5 minutes with the cover on. Set aside to cool.
3. Take the sweet potatoes from Step 1 and peel the skins off. Loosely chop these bad boys and set aside to cool completely. 
4. Take 1 cup of old-fashioned oats and blend them in a food processor for about 5 seconds until broken up. Set aside. 
5. Take 1 can (15 oz.) of black beans and drain the excess liquid. Set aside. 
6. Dice 1/2 of a red/yellow onion and chop 1/2 cup fresh cilantro. 
7. In a large mixing bowl, mix with a large spoon the sweet potatoes, quinoa, black beans, cilantro, and onion. Feel free to add some spices here. I chose to do 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp sea salt, and 1 tsp of 21 salute seasoning from TJ's. This step is super up to personal preference.
8. Next, add in the oats and mix with the large spoon until it becomes a shapeable mixture. 
9. Cover the bowl and place it in the fridge for a bit before you go to cook them. 
10. This recipe should make 6 hefty burgers or 8 regular-sized burgers. Take the mixture from the fridge and begin shaping! I formed all of the burgers, took what I needed, and put the rest in a glass container in the freezer. These can last for a while, making them great in large batches. Also, feel free to store in the fridge for about a week if you think you'll use them sooner than later! 
11. To cook, place them on a frying pan with 1 tsp of coconut oil or EVOO and cook them for 3-4 minutes on each side.
